Multilingual Scientific Glossary
================================

This project aims at documenting words and notations used to communicate in
a scientific style for a few languages. Some expressions are seldom used
out of scientific contexts and are thus less frequently encountered by
language learners. Providing a condensed list of useful phrases may help
understanding and writing scientific documents in another language.

Project Components
------------------

The project comprises:

- a database (in the "data/" directory) that lists expressions
- HTML pages that present the database's content

Pages are intended to be fully accessible through a keyboard and compatible
with screen readers.

Supported Languages

- English
- Spanish
- French

Language supports under development:

- Chinese
