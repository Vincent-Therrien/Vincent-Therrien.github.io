# To Own Ideas / To Abolish Intellectual Property / A World Without Intellectual Property

In 1989, the US government accused multiple countries of infringing on intellectual property.
Americans threatened to adopt any measure necessary to make them enforce stricter patent and
copyright regulations and stop what they perceived as unfair competition [1].

But these countries were not just greedily copying foreign technology, they had very good reasons to
reject patents. In India, domestic manufacturers had less resources to dedicate to research and
couldn't file as many patent applications as foreign companies; the market became dominated by
foreign firms and India had to buy medicine at high prices [2]. In 1970, the Indian government
eliminated some types of patents, which lifted monopolies and allowed Indian companies to make more
affordable medicine [3]. A bit too affordable to some tastes.

Is it legitimate to own ideas in the same way that we can own objects, even when human lives are at
stake? One could say *yes*: ideas can be expensive to come up with and rewarding creators can boost
innovation. One could also say *no*: gatekeeping ideas aggravates inequalities and can hinder
innovation. Depending on whom you ask, you will get vastly different answers, and with an
increasinly connected global economy and technological progress, I want to assess if intellectual
property, IP for short, is actually a positive thing. To make sense out of all this, I'll present a
history of intellectual property, alternative IP frameworks, and try to imagine its future. And if I
do a good job, maybe I'll be able to make up my own mind.


## I. History

But first, history. People have tried to protect their ideas for a long time, and two main main
strategies have emerged for that.

The oldest one is *secrecy*: if you keep ideas within a group, other people have no way of copying
them. For example, Polynesian navigators knew how to travel safely between islands in the Pacific
Ocean by observing stars, birds, waves, and wind patterns [4]. These techniques are taught openly
now, but back in the days, it was in the interest of navigators to keep that expertise for
themselves because it gave them control over travel [5]. Other secrets are more difficult to
contain. Miserere Mei Deus is a piece of music composed in 1638 that the Church kept exclusive for
more than a century by running after anyone who tried to leak and publish the sheet music, until 14
year-old Mozart heard it in the Vatican and transcribed it from memory, essentially pirating 15
minutes of music from the Pope [6]. Secrets are sensitive to leaks and impractical when you
precisely want to sell music or books because other people can copy them for free.

The other solution to protect ideas is *regulation*: you disclose your ideas to the public, but a
central authority, a state, usually, grants a monopoly on the use of those ideas. That's pretty old;
inventors in medieval Venice would obtain monopolies on their inventions through letters patent [7],
derived from a Latin word for "open" [8]. Letters patent were literally "open" legal documents that
granted specific rights or monopolies [9] and their biggest weakness was that they were regional.
Venician artisans made the best mirrors in the 17th century through a very toxic process that often
killed workers before they reached 30 years of age. Venicians could command high prices because no
other country knew how to copy them at that time, but they had no power to enforce their monopolies
in other countries ifever their techniques leaked. That's why, when a French king who wanted to
decorate his gallery with mirrors but was too cheap to pay for them brought Venician workers to
circumvent that monopoly, Venice threaten them, sometimes with the death penalty, to try and bring
'em back. [10]. Another problem with monopolies is that they were somewhat arbitrary. Chocolate, for
instance, had been known in America for millenia and was introduced in Europe by the Spanish, but a
Parisian royal officer was given a 29-year monopoly on it even though he hadn't invented anything
[11]. Eventually, countries set up patent offices to formalize the registration of inventions and
avoid unfair monopolies [12] [13]. They have to meet certain criteria, like novelty and usefulness,
they are evaluated by profesionnals, and inventors need to pay fees; if that's the case, they get a
monopoly on that idea in the country of registration [14].

*Copyright* is another type of IP regulation that covers creative work. That concept didn't exist in
ancient times; people could copy and resell books without compensating the author [15] and since
books were copied manually and expensive, copyright would not have been useful at that time, but
printing made books way more affordable. Ideas started propagating much faster and authorities in
China [16] and Europe reacted by creating censorship laws to control books they considered
dangerous; the Catholic Church even maintained a list of prohibited books until 1966 [17]. These
laws evolved into copyright, gradually giving more rights to authors; for example the Statute of
Anne in Great Britain gave explicit copyright to authors as opposed to publishers [18]. Contrarily
to patents, you don't have to register for copyright, work is protected the moment it is created and
lasts your lifetime plus multiple decades [19]. That's great for creators but it makes it easier to
hike prices. For example, books were much less expensive in Germany than Great Britain in 19th
century because Germans didn't bother with copyright at that time [20].

*Trademark* is another form of IP that protects the identity of a brand with reserved names or
images that others cannot to use without authorization. For instance, "ping-pong" is a registered
trademark [21], so high-profile events use "table tennis" instead to avoid getting sued for using
the reserved name [22]. Trademarks have to be registered and cannot be descriptive or generic words.
Trademarks for "air fryer" [23] and "trampoline" [24] have been invalidated because of that. It's
also why we hear Lego BRICKS [25] and Velcro FASTENER [26]; if a trademark is so often used that it
turns into a generic term, the trademark can be invalidated and the holder loses a market advantage.

*Trade secrets* protect confidential information. They are legally recognized, so employers are
allowed to make their employees sign scary-looking non-disclosure agreements and sue them if they
breach contract [27]. My favorite trade secret is from KFC, which stores its original recipe in a
vault and hires two contractors to mix half the ingredients and make sure that no one has the full
recipe at any time [28]. But secrets are brittle, and no matter how carefully you conceal them,
there's always a risk that some guy from Appalachia reveals the recipe to the whole world [29].
Trade secrets are used a lot by tech companies: search engine algorithms and artificial intelligence
models are often hidden from public view [30]. Secrecy might be the oldest way to protect ideas, but
it's getting more and more valuable in the digital era.

There are two big trends over the history of intellectual property. First, creators were gradually
given more rights over their creations because it is seen as a way to reward their work. For
example, electronic circuits used not to be covered by intellectual property, but Intel complained
to the US government that it could spend millions of dollars developing new chips and, once they hit
the market, competitors could copy and undersell them [31], so the government created a new form of
IP to protect that. Copyright [32] and patent terms have also gotten longer [33] over time. The
other big historical trend is homogenization. If different countries use different IP frameworks,
people can just go to the most permissive legislation to circumvent monopolies, so creators demand
their rights to be harmonized across countries. Multiple international agreements, like the Berne
convention on copyright [34] and the Paris convention on patents [87]. Nowadays, the World Trade
Organization requires all its member states to sign the TRIPS agreement, which enforces strict IP
regulations [35].

IP has become stronger over time, and there is more than what we've seen. Industrial designs protect
the appearance of products [36]. Controlled appelations protect products tied to recognized cultural
practices [37]. Plant varieties can also be protected [38]. There's this general agreement that IP
is a good thing; it's even part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [39].


## II. Alternatives

But just because something is popular doesn't mean we cannot question it. After all, patents paywall
life-saving medicine and copyright give disproportionate power to tech companies. You could also say
that research for these life-saving medicines would not have been funded without patents to protect
them in the first place and that copyright ensures companies can pay their employees. I could
continue this list of pros and cons, but ultimately, we cannot change IP without rethinking how
research gets funded and how creators get paid, instead of asking moral questions like "is IP
good or bad", I wanna ask: "are there viable alternatives to our current IP framework and do they
have concrete advantages over what we have now".

Several political movements have thought of such alternatives, so let's talk about them. REMEMBER,
I'm not defending these political stances nor trying to brainwash you, I'm just explaining how
they handle intellectual property.


### II.I. Communism

The first movement we'll see is communism, now bear with me, it's not a model on how to run the
economy, but it did implement pretty big changes in IP laws, so it's an interesting point of
comparison. Communists want to abolish private property. Factories, railways, ports, mines, any
asset used for large-scale production would be collectively owned because, acording to Marx,
inequalities amplify to untenable levels if only rich people control them, but they don't to abolish
personal property, items for individual use. [40]. Intellectual property is incompatible with
communism because it's a form of private property: it turns knowledge into monopolies that people
are charged money for using. However, copyright, in art for instance, was often seen as less
exploitative than patents, so they were more commonly accepted during transition to communism [41].

Soon after the Bol'sheviki took power in 1917, they abolished patents. On ideological grounds, but
also for practical reasons: they had devised a centrally planned economy. Production and innovation
were all managed by the government, so handing out temporary monopolies to inventors doesn't make
sense in that context, like who are they going to protect their inventions from? There were no
competitors. But the government did care about rewarding inventors, so it introduced a new mechanism
called avtorskiye svidetel'stva, author's certificates. People would register their inventions at
government offices and the state would use them without restriction. Rather than getting monopolies,
inventors would get paid, receive better housing, or promotions at their jobs. Soviet companies also
held trademarks, but individuals could not apply for them [42]. Copyright was handled differently:
authors preserved ownership of their creations, but they could not freely sell them because the
economy was centrally planned. The government decided what would be printed and the value of, say, a
text, was determined not by how much money people were willing to pay for it, but by its length and
genre. Copyright was also more permissive than in the West, for instance it was legal to translate
books without asking permission from right holders [41]. Communists believed states would eventually
dissolve into a stateless, egalitarian society, and IP would have also faded away during that
transition [40], but things went the other way.

First, the soviets reintroduced patents in 1924 to facilitate trade with other countries [43]. This
is not a unique case, the Netherlands, which have never been communist, also got rid of patents and
brought 'em back after caving in to the pressure of their trading partners [44]. Copyright and
trademark protections also got stronger over time: as the USSR joined international partnerships, it
had to adopt stricter IP regulations as part of the deals and they became more and more similar to
their Western counterpart [41] [42]. And on a more fundamental level, centrally planned economies
were not a success. They did pull off very impressive feats [45] [46] [47] [48], but they lagged
behind in fields that were neglected by government planners, like electronics [49] and consumer
goods [50]. They could have fared better without embargos or corruption, but as communist leaders
have themselves recognized [51] [52], markets are better at increasing productivity. Most communist
countries have transitioned to markets [53] and integrated into the global economy; that means
signing intellectual property agreements. China, for instance, used to have an IP regime comparable
to that of the USSR, but as it began trading with Western countries, it adopted stricter IP laws
and it now protects IP efficiently [54].

Another problem with centrally planned economies is that progress is difficult to plan ahead.
Ozempic was developed thanks to lizard venom research [55]. GPUs that power AI models were
originally developed for gaming [56]. Committees managing the economy from ivory towers have a hard
time predicting how apparently unrelated fields combine into new innovations; decentralized markets
do it better. BUT even in capitalist countries, governments have contributed to innovation,
especially for large-scale projects that don't have immediate commercial applications, like the
Internet [57], geopositioning [58], genomics [59], nuclear energy [60]. And since public
organizations are not motivated by profit, they generally care less about copyright. NASA [61]
lets us use most of their images for free. The fully annotated human genome has been publicly
available for years [62]. Like it or not, competition AND collaboration have mutually contributed to
technological progress; you could argue that centrally planned economies fell flat because they got
rid of the former. I wonder what would happen if we did the exact opposite.


### II.II. Libertarians

Libertarianism is a political movement that holds freedom as the most important value [63]. Not
unlimited freedom because we would end up in the Purge; libertarians think it must be limited by the
non-aggression principle [63]: don't "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions"
[64]. This is not a novel idea. It's in the Bible [65] and it has been rephrazed to no end [64]. The
distinguishing feature of libertarianism is that it opposes coercion. No one likes to pay taxes, but
most people see it as necessary to have public schools and fire departments. Libertarians argue that
those things should be voluntarily funded, that we should not be forced into paying for them. They
argue against non-essential state intervention; that means decriminalization of drugs, making
immigration highly permissive, end lobbying, oppose military interventions [63]. It's this meme,
essentially [66]. Most libertarians want to transition from a strong state to a minimal state solely
responsable to enforce the non-aggression principle through courts and police; that's called
minarchism [67]. A minority wants to abolish the state entirely and let markets do everything;
that's called anarcho-capitalism [68].

With that said you might guess that libertarians want to abolish big government-controlled offices
handing out patents and copyright, but it's not really the case because most libertarians regard
intellectual property as a valid form of property that should be protected under the non-aggression
principle [69] [70]. Ayn Rand, yes I know she didn't like libertarians, calling them a "monstrous,
disgusting bunch of people" [71], but her ideas have been described as libertarian [72] and continue
to influence them to this day [73] [74]. She said that creators should be given IP protections
because mental efforts deserve to be rewarded somehow, emphasizing that those protections should be
temporary, otherwise they would paralyze the market [75]. That's true: there's a practice called
patent evergreening often used in the pharmaceutical industry. Patents are generally limited to 20
years, but companies can register new related patents to artificially lengthen their monopolies.
This is legal but it undermines competition [76] [83]. Also, since libertarians oppose government
overreach, they tend to oppose criminal sanctions for piracy because it's a victimless crime, and
libertarians who do not see IP as a valid form of property even want to abolish it entirely; they
think only physical things should be owned [77]. Libertarians don't have a concensus on IP because
they disagree on how big the state should be and on what qualifies as property. Now let's see what
libertarian politicians to about this.

Javier Milei, an "anarcocapitalista en la teoría y minarquista en la práctica" [78], enacted some
reforms to liberalize the Argentinian economy. In 2025, he deregulated the sociedades de gestión
colectiva, which are state-approved organizations acting as intermediaries between creators and
consumers of copyrighted material. Instead of having to go through them, creators now can sign deals
directly with clients, which is more similar to how things work in North America [79]. But Milei's
government has not signaled any intention of modifying copyright or patent laws. He would have to
convince the World Trade Organization to make big changes, good luck with that. Elsewhere, the
Canadian Libertarian Party used to propose reviewing existing IP regulation [80], but its current
platform does not mention IP anymore [81], just like the US Libertarian party [82]. They either
don't care or don't think it's realistic to change it.

A lot of people are claiming to be libertarians but parties actually following libertarian
principles seldom win elections. One explanation for this is most people think collective action is
the best solution to a collective problem. Thalidomide is a drug used to treat cancer and other
diseases that causes birth defects when pregnant women take it. In the 1950s it got approved in most
European countries and caused complications on thousands of babies, but the US was largely exempt
because the FDA investigator in charge wanted proof that it was safe to fetal development and, well,
never received it [88]. Governments strengthened their validation mechanisms to avoid this, but
libertarians argue they amplify the problem because regulations complicate competition, preventing
markets and civil lawsuits from resolving these issues. Here's one example: in 2015, Turing
Pharmaceuticals hiked the price of Daraprim from 13 dollars 50 cents to 750 dollars. That drug had
been approved by the FDA in 1953 and the patents have long expired, but no generic was available
because, long story short, that market is small and competitors didn't think it would be profitable
to get generics approved by the FDA. It was not an IP problem; regulations inadvertently favored a
monopoly [86]. So yeah, regulation loopholes do harm consumers and we absolutely have to patch them,
but having no regulation is much worse. We'd still have asbestos [84] [85], ozone layer depletion
[89], DDT [90], lead paint [91]. Companies don't care if they kill people and markets have never
been quick enough to fix those issues. Time for another alternative.


### II.III. Anarchism

Anarchism is a political movement that aims at abolishing hierarchies [92]. That means no state and
no regulated markets, just people voluntarily self-organizing. People started proposing that in the
19th century [93] [94] [122] and have been... successively crushed [95] [96] [97]. There are some
exceptions, the Zapatista rebel movement in Chiaspas, Mexico is de facto autonomous and managed
through direct democracy [98], but its economy is fairly small, it struggles to repress organized
violence [99], and this model has not been transposed to larger societies. It's pretty hard to
imagine how global supply chains and high technology could work without markets or regulations
[100], and anarchists have failed to make their positions mainstream. They did influence subcultures
a lot though.

Punk artists were anti-establishment. They created independent labels, organized their own concert
venues, criticized power [101], made their own publications [102]. They rejected authorities,
instead relying on local communities, so they didn't care much about copyright protection at first.
But as punk music became more popular and commercially viable, some artists signed with mainstream
labels, buying into the very system they were criticizing [103]. Sellouts were met with harsh
criticism, the band Crass going as far as saying that punk was dead in the 70s [104]. Many such
cases: alternative rock became commercial [105]. Ballroom culture [106] was appropriated by rainbow
capitalism [107]. Breaking [108] ended up at the Olympics [109]. This isn't all bad, I'm sure a ton
of stuck-up people began appreciating hip hop after seeing it alongside prep stuff. But the original
meaning is often lost in the appropriation, and that can reinforce the power it criticizes.

This is especially relevant in technology. The open source community traces its origin to college
campuses and tech enthousiats who created their own software instead of relying on companies [110].
Some had very strong positions against copyright and censorship. For instance, the Declaration of
the Independence of Cyberspace [111], written in 1996 by a guy who wrote lyrics for a punk singer
[112], claims that the Internet ought to remain free of any government interference. "Information
wants to be free" was the word of the day for many [113]. For others, like Linus Torvalds, developer
of the Linux kernel, have more compromising views and are willing to use proprietary software [114].
While open source projects have become increasingly impactful, the subcultures that created them
have been appropriated by tech giants, who rely on unpaid labor [115] and use hacker imagery for
marketing [116]. At the same time, they contribute to open source, paying their employees to
maintain it [117] [118]. This tension is especially obvious with OpenAPI, which claims from the
beginning that it wants to create transparent AI to the benefit of all humankind and makes some
results available to the public, but it keeps its models secret [119].

Anarchism has trouble gaining power because it opposes power in the first place, but there will
always be people who reject social norms and experiment alternatives [120]. Anarchists have
contributed to other more mainstream issues: they were active in worker's unions for instance [121].
But some people with similar views prefer to make more compromises; to reform authority from within.


### II.IV. Pirate Parties

Pirate parties are political parties active in multiple countries that defend digital rights. They
started in Sweden - of course -

Cory Doctorow, a guy mainly known for coining the word of the decade, has argued in favor of
decreasing copyright protection. [ADD-EXAMPLES].

- DNA, immortal cell lines
- Non-profit organizations (open-source communities, governments, scientific publications)
- Inconsistencies in IP systems: business patents (one-click buys), ...
- Inequalities between countries

- Freerider's problem (paying tickets, not totally comparable to non-rivalrous goods)
- Misallocation of resources
  - time spent on lawsuits by Wright brothers could have been better spent
- Redefin ownership itself (brain implants, biopiracy)

// Non-rivalrous goods, Freerider's problem

- Trademark (luxury goods -> reasons to buy)

AIDS medication in Africa

I've already talked about it before: technological progress is not decreasing the time we spend
working, it encourages people to consume more goods and services. We could work much less if we
wasted less resources and addressed inefficiencies, but that will not happen because people are
way more motivated by the prospect of owning multiple cars than the idea of spending more time with
their family. Unless some massive cultural shift or technological leap occurs, the idea of a
post-scarcity economy is a pipedream, and any discussion about copyright involving that kind of
utopian society is too unrealistic to be worthy of my interest.

I think there are three main points that complicate debates about IP laws. First, left/right, private/public, no point of comparison

Preemptive actions, e.g.: games requiring online registration, Nvidia locking CUDA to chips

patents are public, encourage publication
Copyright protects ideas because, otherwise, they would not exist in the first place
Public research can lose funding if the research does not generate immediate results or is not perceived as useful by the public

Anyways, I'll leave my opinions on libertarians for the last section because otherwise people will
say I'm not objectivist enough.

Nvidia controlling drivers through signing
Apple establishing a monopoly on App store without patent
Airline surveillance pricing
Patents are only used by large companies

    his ability to supply them.... [Therefore] it will be necessary to have an agency for determining

tailwind -> open-source business models don't make sense when AI can understand it without paying

A lot of people become weirdly emotional when you fail to display religious adoration for AI.

Information asymetry

It's not always a hive mind


## IV. What I Think of This

Brain implant software copyright

I could stop there and pretend that I am a completely neutral observer, but I have an opinion on
this topic and I think it's more honest to state it so that you're aware of my biases and can look
at the video more critically.

I think that technical intellectual property, like patents, circuit designs, and algorithms, should
be weakened because they have a tendency to reinforce monopolies, but artistic copyrights should not
be modified because they do not cause negative impacts.

disco balls were patented

I mean, that's a bit like saying "by not paying for a subway ticket, I don't steal the wagons.
They would keep running regardless of whether I pay not not, so that's not theft!". But you're
benefitting from that service. The operator has to get money somehow, either by demanding fares or
getting paid from taxes. So when people say "I'm not stealing a game, the creator still keeps their
copy so it's not theft!", they are benefitting from someone's work without compensation. And pirates
themselves recognize that, asking people to pay for games from small developpers that rely on that
income. But how small exactly do you have to be to deserve money? It's very arbitrary, instead of
being based on agreed-upon rules, the amount of money that a creator can expect is based on
anonymous opinions, that seems pretty unfair.

It's pretty common in pirate communities to ask people to pay for a game after they've obtained it
for free to reward creators, we've seen it with Silksong. But how many of these people actually paid
the game after playing it instead of just virtue-signaling on image boards? We don't have official
statistics but I would wager it's not much. People who disagree with that stance get pushed away
because they give pirates a bad name and those who paid the game will go out of their way to tell
everyone. That probably gives us a distorded view.

Pirate parties
Like who works on their PR team? Who thought that normies would like to vote for people brandishing
Jolly Rogers and stupid takes about CSAM? I know, from their own perspective, they are cool and
edgy frihetskämpar, but most people find them weird, and that's not a good thing if you want them to
vote for you.

- open access / open source / ...

And, is the state really that bad?  Every year, the Cato and Fraser Institutes, two right-wing
libertarian think tanks, rank countries based on how free their citizens are. They've consistently
ranked social-democratic countries as more free than the US. Behold Switzerland, the libertarian
terre promise with high taxes, free healthcare and free college.

People are not knowledgeable on all topics and often disinterested, but if you can sit them down and
explain an issue well enough, they'd probably also reach the same conclusion that collective action
is necessary

// Invisible hand -> recreate government-like structures -> same as libertarianism last paragraph

[X] argued that government-like structures would re-emerge after its abolition though a process
managed by the invisible hand. I find that statement fascinating: he'd get rid of a functionning
state instead of improving it, and then wait until the same services would naturally reappear in a
more effective form. Why would they? Why would all these complex rules re-emerge magically in the
same way? I think this is a sign of excessively introverted people doing politics. They don't
realize that political viewpoints are vastly more varied than they imagine, so they end up imposing
their own beliefs onto everyone and think that we'd build the idea of a perfect society like a hive
mind.

These actions have proven to work, and they are getting more and more popular. Meanwhile, copyright
laws have been getting stronger and stronger, and I don't see that trend changing course. I don't
think the work of pirate parties is completely useless, but let's be realistic: they will never
repeal TRIPS.

Personal interest / common good + ideas are private property / ideas are not (disagreement on priorities + definitions)

A philosophical argument I've often heard against IP laws is that they are "legal fictions", id est
social constructs we collectively agree upon but which have no basis in reality. When you copy
someone else's idea, you are not preventing them from continuing to use it, you're not stealing
anything, so assimilating ideas to private property is illogical, per that argument. You're not
stealing, but you are benefiting from their work without compensating them, and even anti-copyright
folks are quick to call that unfair [sky]. Yes, IP law is a legal fiction. yes, it is imperfect, but
so are a ton of other things in modern life. Some people argue that taxation shouldn't exist
because it is a form of coercion to which we do not consent. But we kind of need taxes. The courts
and roads are not gonna pay themselves, so the government has to get money somehow, not necessarily
from revenue, but it needs to find money to function. Yes, taxation is a social construct, yes, no
one likes it, but modern societies need it. So we shouldn't rule out laws on philosophical grounds,
especially when they have tangible benefits.

Overall, I just don't believe in all-encompassing solutions. I don't believe a state can ever be
competent enough to plan an entire economy because it will always grow into an inefficient,
unaccountable bureaucracy. I don't believe that removing commercial regulations will lead to more
prosperity because free markets are often incapable of addressing collective problems. Libertarian
parties regularly deny climate change, and they have to, their ideology is too inflexible to account
for it. And I don't believe that getting rid of intellectual property will somehow lead to more
innovation and equality. People who already have power would just consolidate it. At the same time,
keeping IP laws as they are also harms the economy, and I absolutely think they should be reformed.

To own ideas is not an end it itself, what matters is that creators get rewarded for their work, but
we all benefit from passing ideas around as much as possible.

Creators deserved to be rewarded fairly, but to own ideas is not and end in itself; in fact we all
benefit when ideas get passed around as much as possible, and constraining them prevents new ideas
from emerging.

I'm not emotionally or ideologically attached to copyright per se; I care about creators getting
fairly rewarded for their work

Monopolies naturally emerge for the simple reason that having capital makes it easier to amass more
capital. This is the most unterly unsurprising result of our system.

- But this most extreme view of copyright abolition is promoted basically only by hardcore
  libertarians and communists. The most level-headed people in the world!
- A worrying trend is how copyright laws are decided by non-elected people held at watergun point
  by private companies, not very democratic.

Amazon ultimately owns the wizard of Oz

Some people say that you cannot own ideas because because they are not tangible, and therefore
replicating them is not theft, in other words, IP is just a legal fiction. But a lot of things are
legal fictions. Land ownership is one, sure, land is a physical thing and you can defend it with
fences, but the land itself is not separated. You could even say that land ownership encroaches on
the rights of others by preventing them from traversing it. If I plant a tent on someone else's
property, I'm not stealing the land.

I'm not saying that ownership doesn't exist; my point is that all forms of ownership are social
contracts. I own the money in my credit union account because all the parties involved agree that
it's my property, but I don't have physical access to it. So, sure, IP is a legal ficton, but so are
most forms of property. Instead of looking at laws through axiomatic lenses and deciding what counts
as valid property based on ideological grounds, we should spend more mental effort thinknig about
their concrete effects.

Axiomatic libertarians

I guess this is what happens when you center a political project around an ideology instead of human
lives.

Clarence Thomas read Atlas Shrugged

Anarchocapitalism was coined in Playboy

CW: Earth-vitrifying hot take - I guess my conclusion is that Les Misérables is better than Wicked.

The pirate parties are really giving "redditors breached containment"

Patents don't stop innovation because you have to publish all details, so they discourage trade
secrets (incomplete CRISPR patent).

It's also good to pause and ask if a political project is realistic. Like, I dream of displacing the
132 highway away from the Saint-Lawrence and restoring the original litoral ecosystem, but I know
it's not gonna happen and I don't spend my time talking about it, except when I've had too many
edibles.

Ok so that was my take. If you got mad or if you want my full review of Wicked for Good leave a
comment.

And to people who say that I've drunk the Kool-aid and just agree with mainstream opinions, that I'm
a centrist who's afraid of change, I say: we cannot remain teenagers forever. At one point you have
to accept that the world is imperfect and does not bent our personal preferences.

And that might be controversial, but I think fairness matters more than the speed of innovation.
Like, if there had been no patents to motivate people to invent airplanes and steam machines, maybe
increased competition would have stimulated inventiveness more and these technologies would have
been invented a few years earlier. In the grand scheme of things, is that really valuable compared
to rewarding inventors fairly? Also, patents are public, you are free to read them and get inspired
to invent new stuff, so they don't really prevent innovation, they just create temporary monopolies.

For example, libertarian think tanks have repeatedly denied scientific evidence when they contradict
libertarian orthodoxy. Instead of modifying their ideology, they decide to ignore objective reality
and lie to people their stance is incompatible with reality. An ideology should be at the service of
human flourishing, if the goal of the ideology is to reaffirm itself to the detriment of our
wellbeing, then it's as trash an ideology as manufacturing an infinite supply of paperclips for the
sake of making more papaerclips.

Competition is the father on invention

Stability: a political system needs to accomodate diverse perspective
- La belle verte: conflicts arises from differences; in perspective or interests. A society without
  conflict can only exist if there are no differences.

By imposing a narrow and culture-specific definition of freedom onto everyone, are libertarians not
stripping others people of their freedom of opinion?

Actually, I would add a tier worse than entertainment: art made for propaganda, which I find akin to
advertisement. [Apple superbowl ad VS armya moya], choose your poison.

When an idea is impopular for several years, it's not because there's a sinister conspiracy
censoring it, it's because it's an impopular idea. Most people believe that intellectual property is
a good thing.

And I know that any comment about AI that is not religious adoration is regarded as some horrible
sin by a lot of people

Libertarian economic arguments are fossilized in pre-WWII rethoric

Consent: Scarlett Johnson voice, Altman rape allegations, Groq CSAM

Assistive AI / generative AI
Unconscious consumption / Intentful consumption

I feel like I'll get a lot of questions if I don't state my opinion on piracy. I think it's fairly
obvious just how low I think of tech companies and how inconsequential I find pirating them, but for
small creators I do think it is unethical, as acknowledged by members of that community.

Another point is that empathy is in our nature. Nathaniel Branden, a psychologist and *associate* of
Ayn Rand, eventually recognized that her ideas of virtuous selfishness are *wrong*, that they harm
people who put them in practice, and this observation has been validated numerous times.
Intellectual property is kind of based on empathy, we give monopolies to creators because we can
imagine what it feels like not to be rewarded for hard work. I mean, you can also make the point
that IP is in our selfish interest because it drives innovation, which benefits us, but that's not
the entire story.

  - Paragraph 26 on page 14 explains how foreign companies dominated patents in India:
    "The Patents Enquiry Committee have in their interim report [...] set out the figures of patents
    granted in various countries during the period 1930—37 together with the proportion of grants to
    its own nationals as compared with the number granted to foreigners. [...]. During this period
    the proportion of grants to Indians and foreigners is stated to be roughly 1:9. Even with the
    attainment of independence and rapid growth of scientific education by the opening of more
    institutions for post-graduate training and the establishment of several national laboratories,
    the proportion of Indian to foreign patents still remains substantially the same as during the
    earlier period, and is roughly 1:2 [...]. This is, however, without taking into account the
    economic or industrial or scientific importance of the inventions. If this factor were taken
    into account [...], our nationals would appear to be at even less advantage"
  - Paragraph 101 on page 39 explains the rationale behind removing product patents:
    "The reason for this state of law is stated to be that the denial of product claims is necessary
    in order that such important articles of daily use as medicine or food which are vital to
    the health of the community should be made available to every one at reasonable prices and
    that no monopoly should be granted in respect of such articles. It is considered that the refusal
    of product patents would enlarge the area of competition and thus result in the production of
    these articles in sufficient quantity and at the lowest possible cost to the public."

  - This paragraph on page 17 talks about how secretive navigators were:
    "Not that men fully trained in these important arts
    would necessarily have revealed their knowledge even if
    asked. We have evidence from widely separated parts of
    Oceania that navigational lore was usually restricted to a
    few and often considered secret, so that in the Marshalls
    it was 'strongly and religiously forbidden to divulge any-
    thing converning this art to the people' (Winkler, 1901:
    505), and in the Tahitian area there were 'few men who
    preserve the national traditions' (Forster, G., 1777: vol.
    II, 148). It is questionable whether Tupaia himself would
    have been so co-operative had he not been in exile and
    deprived of his proper position."
    Tupaia was a Polynesian navigator who assisted Lewis in writing the book.

  - Page 125: "Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and of physical
    effort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into a material form. The
    proportion of these two elements varies in different types of work. At the lowest end of the
    scale, the mental effort required to perform unskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other
    end, what the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in
    the production of material values; these laws protect the mind's contribution in its purest form
    the origination of an idea. The subject of patents and copyrights is intellectual property. ...
    Thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which it has brought in existence"

    generations, which would ultimately paralyze them."

  - "As part of their fundamental disavowal of the corporate record industry, most hardcore bands
    self-produced and self-released their albums, sometimes through small DIY labels. The music and
    culture of hardcore was promoted through word of mouth and fanzines. As the genre grew in
    popularity, its musical acts developed numerous sonic variations and included political messages
    in their lyrics."
