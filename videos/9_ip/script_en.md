# To Own Ideas / To Abolish Intellectual Property / A World Without Intellectual Property

In 1989, the US government accused multiple countries of infringing on intellectual property.
Americans threatened to adopt any measure necessary to make them enforce stricter patent and
copyright regulations and stop what they perceived as unfair competition [1].

But these countries were not just greedily copying foreign technology, they had very good reasons to
reject patents. In India, domestic manufacturers had less resources to dedicate to research and
couldn't file as many patent applications as foreign companies; the market became dominated by
foreign firms and India had to buy medicine at high prices [2]. In 1970, the Indian government
eliminated some types of patents, which lifted monopolies and allowed Indian companies to make more
affordable medicine [3]. A bit too affordable to some tastes.

Is it legitimate to own ideas in the same way that we can own objects, even when human lives are at
stake? You could say *yes*: ideas can be expensive to come up with and rewarding creators can boost
innovation. You could also say *no*: gatekeeping ideas aggravates inequalities and can hinder
innovation. Depending on whom you ask, you will get vastly different answers, and with an
increasinly connected global economy and technological progress, I want to assess if intellectual
property, IP for short, is actually a positive thing. To make sense out of all this, I'll present a
history of intellectual property, alternative IP frameworks, and try to imagine its future. And if I
do a good job, maybe I'll be able to make up my own mind.


## I. History

But first, history. People have tried to protect their ideas for a long time, and two main main
strategies have emerged for that.

The oldest one is *secrecy*: if you keep ideas within a group, other people have no way of copying
them. For example, Polynesian navigators knew how to travel safely between islands in the Pacific
Ocean by observing stars, birds, waves, and wind patterns [4]. These techniques are taught openly
now, but back in the days, it was in the interest of navigators to keep that expertise for
themselves because it gave them control over travel [5]. Other secrets are more difficult to
contain. Miserere Mei Deus is a piece of music composed in 1638 that the Church kept exclusive for
more than a century by running after anyone who tried to leak and publish the sheet music, until 14
year-old Mozart heard it in the Vatican and transcribed it from memory, essentially pirating 15
minutes of music from the Pope [6]. Secrets are sensitive to leaks and impractical when you
precisely want to sell music or books because other people can copy them for free.

The other solution to protect ideas is *regulation*: you disclose your ideas to the public, but a
central authority, a state, usually, grants a monopoly on the use of those ideas. That's pretty old;
inventors in medieval Venice would obtain monopolies on their inventions through letters patent [7],
derived from a Latin word for "open" [8]. Letters patent were literally "open" legal documents that
granted specific rights or monopolies [9] and their biggest weakness was that they were regional.
Venician artisans made the best mirrors in the 17th century through a very toxic process that often
killed workers before they reached 30 years of age. Venicians could command high prices because no
other country knew how to copy them at that time, but they had no power to enforce their monopolies
in other countries ifever their techniques leaked. That's why, when a French king who wanted to
decorate his gallery with mirrors but was too cheap to pay for them brought Venician workers to
circumvent that monopoly, Venice threaten them, sometimes with the death penalty, to try and bring
'em back. [10]. Another problem with monopolies is that they were somewhat arbitrary. Chocolate, for
instance, had been known in America for millenia and was introduced in Europe by the Spanish, but a
Parisian royal officer was given a 29-year monopoly on it even though he hadn't invented anything
[11]. Eventually, countries set up patent offices to formalize the registration of inventions and
avoid unfair monopolies [12] [13]. They have to meet certain criteria, like novelty and usefulness,
they are evaluated by profesionnals, and inventors need to pay fees; if that's the case, they get a
monopoly on that idea in the country of registration [14].

*Copyright* is another type of IP regulation that covers creative work. That concept didn't exist in
ancient times; people could copy and resell books without compensating the author [15] and since
books were copied manually and expensive, copyright would not have been useful at that time, but
printing made books way more affordable. Ideas started propagating much faster and authorities in
China [16] and Europe reacted by creating censorship laws to control books they considered
dangerous; the Catholic Church even maintained a list of prohibited books until 1966 [17]. These
laws evolved into copyright, gradually giving more rights to authors; for example the Statute of
Anne in Great Britain gave explicit copyright to authors as opposed to publishers [18]. Contrarily
to patents, you don't have to register for copyright, work is protected the moment it is created and
lasts your lifetime plus multiple decades [19]. That's great for creators but it makes it easier to
hike prices. For example, books were much less expensive in Germany than Great Britain in 19th
century because Germans didn't bother with copyright at that time [20].

*Trademark* is another form of IP that protects the identity of a brand with reserved names or
images that others cannot to use without authorization. For instance, "ping-pong" is a registered
trademark [21], so high-profile events use "table tennis" instead to avoid getting sued for using
the reserved name [22]. Trademarks have to be registered and cannot be descriptive or generic words.
Trademarks for "air fryer" [23] and "trampoline" [24] have been invalidated because of that. It's
also why we hear Lego BRICKS [25] and Velcro FASTENER [26]; if a trademark is so often used that it
turns into a generic term, the trademark can be invalidated and the holder loses a market advantage.

*Trade secrets* protect confidential information. They are legally recognized, so employers are
allowed to make their employees sign scary-looking non-disclosure agreements and sue them if they
breach contract [27]. My favorite trade secret is from KFC, which stores its original recipe in a
vault and hires two contractors to mix half the ingredients and make sure that no one has the full
recipe at any time [28]. But secrets are brittle, and no matter how carefully you conceal them,
there's always a risk that some guy from Appalachia reveals the recipe to the whole world [29].
Trade secrets are used a lot by tech companies: search engine algorithms and artificial intelligence
models are often hidden from public view [30]. Secrecy might be the oldest way to protect ideas, but
it's getting more and more valuable in the digital era.

There are two big trends over the history of intellectual property. First, creators were gradually
given more rights over their creations because it is seen as a way to reward their work. For
example, electronic circuits used not to be covered by intellectual property, but Intel complained
to the US government that it could spend millions of dollars developing new chips and, once they hit
the market, competitors could copy and undersell them [31], so the government created a new form of
IP to protect that. Copyright [32] and patent terms have also gotten longer [33] over time. The
other big historical trend is homogenization. If different countries use different IP frameworks,
people can just go to the most permissive legislation to circumvent monopolies, so creators demand
their rights to be harmonized across countries. Multiple international agreements, like the Berne
convention on copyright [34] and the Paris convention on patents [87]. Nowadays, the World Trade
Organization requires all its member states to sign the TRIPS agreement, which enforces strict IP
regulations [35].

IP has become stronger over time, and there is more than what we've seen. Industrial designs protect
the appearance of products [36]. Controlled appellations protect products tied to recognized
cultural practices [37]. Plant varieties can also be protected [38]. There's this general agreement
that IP is a good thing; it's even part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [39].


## II. Alternatives

But just because something is popular doesn't mean we cannot question it. After all, patents paywall
life-saving medicine and copyright give disproportionate power to tech companies. You could also say
that research for these life-saving medicines would not have been funded without patents to protect
them in the first place and that copyright ensures companies can pay their employees. I could
continue this list of pros and cons, but ultimately, we cannot change IP without rethinking how
research gets funded and how creators get paid, instead of asking moral questions like "is IP
good or bad", I wanna ask: "are there viable alternatives to our current IP framework and do they
have concrete advantages over what we have now".

Several political movements have thought of such alternatives, so let's talk about them. REMEMBER,
I'm not defending these political stances nor trying to brainwash you, I'm just explaining how
they handle intellectual property.


### II.I. Communism

The first movement we'll see is communism, now bear with me, it's not a model on how to run the
economy, but it did implement pretty big changes in IP laws, so it's an interesting point of
comparison. Communists want to abolish private property. Factories, railways, ports, mines, any
asset used for large-scale production would be collectively owned because, acording to Marx,
inequalities amplify to untenable levels if only rich people control them, but they don't to abolish
personal property, items for individual use. [40]. Intellectual property is incompatible with
communism because it's a form of private property: it turns knowledge into monopolies that people
are charged money for using. However, copyright, in art for instance, was often seen as less
exploitative than patents, so they were more commonly accepted during transition to communism [41].

Soon after the Bol'sheviki took power in 1917, they abolished patents. On ideological grounds, but
also for practical reasons: they had devised a centrally planned economy. Production and innovation
were all managed by the government, so handing out temporary monopolies to inventors doesn't make
sense in that context, like who are they going to protect their inventions from? There were no
competitors. But the government did care about rewarding inventors, so it introduced a new mechanism
called avtorskiye svidetel'stva, author's certificates. People would register their inventions at
government offices and the state would use them without restriction. Rather than getting monopolies,
inventors would get paid, receive better housing, or promotions at their jobs. Soviet companies also
held trademarks, but individuals could not apply for them [42]. Copyright was handled differently:
authors preserved ownership of their creations, but they could not freely sell them because the
economy was centrally planned. The government decided what would be printed and the value of, say, a
text, was determined not by how much money people were willing to pay for it, but by its length and
genre. Copyright was also more permissive than in the West, for instance it was legal to translate
books without asking permission from right holders [41]. Communists believed states would eventually
dissolve into a stateless, egalitarian society, and IP would have also faded away during that
transition [40], but things went the other way.

First, the soviets reintroduced patents in 1924 to facilitate trade with other countries [43]. This
is not a unique case, the Netherlands, which have never been communist, also got rid of patents and
brought 'em back after caving in to the pressure of their trading partners [44]. Copyright and
trademark protections also got stronger over time: as the USSR joined international partnerships, it
had to adopt stricter IP regulations as part of the deals and they became more and more similar to
their Western counterpart [41] [42]. And on a more fundamental level, centrally planned economies
were not a success. They did pull off very impressive feats [45] [46] [47] [48], but they lagged
behind in fields that were neglected by government planners, like electronics [49] and consumer
goods [50]. They could have fared better without embargos or corruption, but as communist leaders
have themselves recognized [51] [52], markets are better at increasing productivity. Most communist
countries have transitioned to markets [53] and integrated into the global economy; that means
signing intellectual property agreements. China, for instance, used to have an IP regime comparable
to that of the USSR, but as it began trading with Western countries, it adopted stricter IP laws
and it now protects IP efficiently [54].

Another problem with centrally planned economies is that progress is difficult to plan ahead.
Ozempic was developed thanks to lizard venom research [55]. GPUs that power AI models were
originally developed for gaming [56]. Committees managing the economy from ivory towers have a hard
time predicting how apparently unrelated fields combine into new innovations; decentralized markets
do it better. BUT even in capitalist countries, governments have contributed to innovation,
especially for large-scale projects that don't have immediate commercial applications, like the
Internet [57], geopositioning [58], genomics [59], nuclear energy [60]. And since public
organizations are not motivated by profit, they generally care less about copyright. NASA [61]
lets us use most of their images for free. The fully annotated human genome has been publicly
available for years [62]. Like it or not, competition AND collaboration have mutually contributed to
technological progress; you could argue that centrally planned economies fell flat because they got
rid of the former. I wonder what would happen if we did the exact opposite.


### II.II. Libertarians

Libertarianism is a political movement that holds freedom as the most important value [63]. Not
unlimited freedom because we would end up in the Purge; libertarians think it must be limited by the
non-aggression principle [63]: don't "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions"
[64]. This is not a novel idea. It's in the Bible [65] and it has been rephrazed to no end [64]. The
distinguishing feature of libertarianism is that it opposes coercion. No one likes to pay taxes, but
most people see it as necessary to have public schools and fire departments. Libertarians argue that
those things should be voluntarily funded, that we should not be forced into paying for them. They
argue against non-essential state intervention; that means decriminalization of drugs, making
immigration highly permissive, end lobbying, oppose military interventions [63]. It's this meme,
essentially [66]. Most libertarians want to transition from a strong state to a minimal state solely
responsable to enforce the non-aggression principle through courts and police; that's called
minarchism [67]. A minority wants to abolish the state entirely and let markets do everything;
that's called anarcho-capitalism [68].

With that said you might guess that libertarians want to abolish big government-controlled offices
handing out patents and copyright, but it's not really the case because most libertarians regard
intellectual property as a valid form of property that should be protected under the non-aggression
principle [69] [70]. Ayn Rand, yes I know she didn't like libertarians, calling them a "monstrous,
disgusting bunch of people" [71], but her ideas have been described as libertarian [72] and continue
to influence them to this day [73] [74]. She said that creators should be given IP protections
because mental efforts deserve to be rewarded somehow, emphasizing that those protections should be
temporary, otherwise they would paralyze the market [75]. That's true: there's a practice called
patent evergreening often used in the pharmaceutical industry. Patents are generally limited to 20
years, but companies can register new related patents to artificially lengthen their monopolies.
This is legal but it undermines competition [76] [83]. Also, since libertarians oppose government
overreach, they tend to oppose criminal sanctions for piracy because it's a victimless crime, and
libertarians who do not see IP as a valid form of property even want to abolish it entirely; they
think only physical things should be owned [77]. Libertarians don't have a concensus on IP because
they disagree on how big the state should be and on what qualifies as property. Now let's see what
libertarian politicians to about this.

Javier Milei, an "anarcocapitalista en la teoría y minarquista en la práctica" [78], enacted some
reforms to liberalize the Argentinian economy. In 2025, he deregulated the sociedades de gestión
colectiva, which are state-approved organizations acting as intermediaries between creators and
consumers of copyrighted material. Instead of having to go through them, creators now can sign deals
directly with clients, which is more similar to how things work in North America [79]. But Milei's
government has not signaled any intention of modifying copyright or patent laws. He would have to
convince the World Trade Organization to make big changes, good luck with that. Elsewhere, the
Canadian Libertarian Party used to propose reviewing existing IP regulation [80], but its current
platform does not mention IP anymore [81], just like the US Libertarian party [82]. They either
don't care or don't think it's realistic to change it.

A lot of people are claiming to be libertarians but parties actually following libertarian
principles seldom win elections. One explanation for this is most people think collective action is
the best solution to a collective problem. Thalidomide is a drug used to treat cancer and other
diseases that causes birth defects when pregnant women take it. In the 1950s it got approved in most
European countries and caused complications on thousands of babies, but the US was largely exempt
because the FDA investigator in charge wanted proof that it was safe to fetal development and, well,
never received it [88]. Governments strengthened their validation mechanisms to avoid this, but
libertarians argue they amplify the problem because regulations complicate competition, preventing
markets and civil lawsuits from resolving these issues. Here's one example: in 2015, Turing
Pharmaceuticals hiked the price of Daraprim from 13 dollars 50 cents to 750 dollars. That drug had
been approved by the FDA in 1953 and the patents have long expired, but no generic was available
because, long story short, that market is small and competitors didn't think it would be profitable
to get generics approved by the FDA. It was not an IP problem; regulations inadvertently favored a
monopoly [86]. So yeah, regulation loopholes do harm consumers and we absolutely have to patch them,
but without regulations we'd still have asbestos [84] [85], ozone layer depletion [89], DDT [90],
lead paint [91]. Markets were not quick enough to address those and companies don't care if they
kill people; time for another alternative.


### II.III. Anarchism

Anarchism is a political movement that aims at abolishing hierarchies [92]. That means no state and
no regulated markets, just people voluntarily self-organizing. People started proposing that in the
19th century [93] [94] [122] and have been... successively crushed [95] [96] [97]. There are some
exceptions, the Zapatista rebel movement in Chiapas, Mexico is de facto autonomous and managed
through direct democracy [98], but its economy is fairly small, it struggles to repress organized
violence [99], and this model has not been transposed to larger societies. It's pretty hard to
imagine how global supply chains and high technology could work without markets or regulations
[100], and anarchists have failed to make their positions mainstream. They did influence subcultures
a lot though.

Punk artists were anti-establishment. They created independent labels, organized their own concert
venues, criticized power [101], made their own publications [102]. They rejected authorities,
instead relying on local communities, so they didn't care much about copyright protection at first.
But as punk music became more popular and commercially viable, some artists signed with mainstream
labels, buying into the very system they were criticizing [103]. Sellouts were met with harsh
criticism, the band Crass going as far as saying that punk was dead in the 70s [104]. Many such
cases: alternative rock became commercial [105]. Ballroom culture [106] was appropriated by rainbow
capitalism [107]. Breaking [108] ended up at the Olympics [109]. This isn't all bad, I'm sure a ton
of stuck-up people began appreciating hip hop after seeing it alongside prep stuff. But the original
meaning is often lost in the appropriation, and that can reinforce the power it criticizes.

This is especially relevant in technology. The open source community traces its origin to college
campuses and tech enthousiats who created their own software instead of relying on companies [110].
Some had very strong positions against copyright and censorship. For instance, the Declaration of
the Independence of Cyberspace [111], written in 1996 by a guy who wrote lyrics for a punk singer
[112], claims that the Internet ought to remain free of any government interference. "Information
wants to be free" was the word of the day for many [113]. For others, like Linus Torvalds, developer
of the Linux kernel, have more compromising views and are willing to use proprietary software [114].
While open source projects have become increasingly impactful, the subcultures that created them
have been appropriated by tech giants, who rely on unpaid labor [115] and use hacker imagery for
marketing [116]. At the same time, they contribute to open source, paying their employees to
maintain it [117] [118]. The idealistic view is that people just freely collaborate on wonderful
projects, but everyone has to confront the reality that we need to eat. They either work on open
source for free and have other sources of income, or receive donations, or monetize documentation or
other add-ons, or accept contributions from tech giants. This tension is especially obvious with
OpenAPI, which was set up to create transparent AI but keeps its models secret [119].

Anarchism has trouble gaining power because it opposes power in the first place, but there will
always be people who reject social norms and create alternatives [120]. Anarchists have contributed
to other more mainstream issues: they were active in worker's unions for instance [121]. So far,
they have been better at experimenting solutions that replacing political systems, but some people
with similar views want to do just that: change the system from within.


### II.IV. Pirate Parties

Pirate parties are political parties active in multiple countries that defend digital rights. The
first one started in January 2006. In Sweden, of course [123]. It got a boost in popularity later
that year when the Swedish police raided The Pirate Bay [124], an unaffiliated website that
facilitates torrenting. Which is illegal! The guys who ran that site were eventually sent on trial
and then sent to prison after being found guilty of copyright infringement [125]. Political figures
and the media agreed with that decision [126] [127], but a lot of people who oppose copyright
disagreed and ralied around the pirate party, which did get some people elected in the European
parliament [128]. Other similar parties were created in elsewhere, and tend, likewise, to focus on
decreasing copyright and patent terms, reducing sentences for infringement, advocating for more
freedom of expression and government transparency. They often address what they perceive as
excessive authority from the state, but they also target mass surveillance and power concentration
from private companies [129].

Pirate parties have to reconcile ideology with reality. A lot of their members point out that ideas
are non-rivalrous [130]; that copying them does not prevent their creators from continuing to use
them and argue that infringement should therefore not be seen as morally bad. Others argue that,
without IP, there would be fewer ideas to copy because people would have less incentive to create
them. That is, a lot of these non-rivalrous ideas exist *because* of IP. That's difficult to measure
empirically because the whole planet has been operating under a pretty uniform IP framework for
decades. We can do before-and-after comparisons and come to the conclusion that IP increases
research investment [131] or does not affect it much [132] depending on how you analyze the data.
You could also say that people would create without financial incentive anyways and that IP is thus
superfluous [133], but a lot of great work has been created precisely because their authors had the
means to commit full time to it [134]. The WTO will also watch closely if any change in IP law is
attempted, so that can complicate reforms.

The original program of the Swedish pirate party called for the abolition of all pharmaceutical
patents and proposed instead to drive research with government funding, id est, taxes [135]. The
current version is different, saying that IP should be granted when it has "well-documented positive
effects" [129]. But this idea that work traditionally rewarded with IP should be, instead, paid by
the government, is pretty popular in pirate parties. They often defend universal basic income, or
UBI, you know, when the government gives a baseline salary to everyone [136]. It's getting more and
more talked about with automation, and if it ever becomes widespread, it would probably erode the
concept of copyright because creators would no longer depend on owning their work to earn money.
They would still want to be recognized as authors and not plagiarized though, so IP would not
disappear entirely I think. But UBI has never been tried on a large scale. We don't know how to do
it and how it would impact consumption habits or productivity and it would require changing the
economy somewhat [137]. In Ireland, some artists are getting paid by the government in a kind of
limited UBI [138]. This is not an initiative of a pirate party, but, by advocating for similar
moves, we might have a better idea of the impact of UBI and IP reduction.


## III. The Future

With all that said, it's time to wonder how intellectual property will change in the future.


### III.I. The Same IP Mechanisms Will Remain

Kurzum, there a three main ways to handle intellectual property. The first is ownership, we give
monopolies to creators. The second is collectivization, we pay creators through taxes but the ideas
remain free. The third, I'll call 无为 (wúwéi), we don't enforce any IP and don't give any reward.
The dominant IP regime of our time is ownership, but the other two are also relevant; public
research and open source projects are more important than ever. Pirate parties have been trying to
reduce ownership in favor of the other two, but more than twenty years later, they have... failed to
do this. A big reason why people don't rally behind them is that most people support IP to some
extend, and believe creators should be rewarded instead of letting everyone free-ride their work, I
know a ton of people disagree, but this is the mainstream view. Another reason for that failure is
that reforming IP is incredibly hard. It's a framework that spans the entire planet. Before changing
things up, a majority of countries would have to agree on a ton of stuff. Given all that, I really
don't think intellectual property will go away, but alternative models will continue to exist in the
margins and challenge this dominant regime.


### III.II. Monopolies Would Exist Even Without IP

A point I wanna discuss is monopolization. In the pharmaceutical industry especially, patents do
empower companies to hike prices [139]. But monopolies emerge through other processes. Amazon
undersells competitors by dynamically adjusting its prices until they go bankrupt. Short term, this
is good for consumers; competition drives prices down, but once the competitor goes under, the
prices go back up. The power imbalance between small companies the biggest online selling platform
is so big that it makes real competition impossible [140]. Apple has often tried to force its users
and third-party developers to use its own technology by inconveniencing them when they try
alternatives; it has faved antitrust cases because of that [141]. Marketing manipulates consumers.
For instance, paracetamol, also called acetaminophen, was discovered in the 19th century and was
applied to medicine in the mid 20th century. It's inexpensive to make and its basic form is free of
patent, so you can find it on shelves for cheap. But pharmaceutical companies have realized they can
sell it for more money if they bombard consumers with advertisement. Most people don't know Tylenol
is mostly just paracetamol, but they buy it because of brand recognition. The market is not reaching
maximum efficieny; companies use information asymetry, betting on consumers not knowing things to
make money [142]. Likewise, retails companies and airlines [143] are using, or planning to use,
surveillance to charge as much as possible. So, would monopolies evaporate if IP was abolished?
Absolutely not, this is how the system is intended to work.


### III.III. Scientific Progress and Concerns for Justice Will Make Property Evolve

One thing I can predict is that our definition of property will continue to evolve with scientific
progress. For instance, some experimental brain implants are used to manage epilepsy. The
manufacturer owns the device, so when it went bankrupt, the implant has to get removed, even if the
patient didn't want. Some people have pointed out that the implant should be considered part of the
patient's body, and that their body autonomy should prime over ownership laws [144], so new
technology will challenge our existing laws. Also, the World Trade Organization *can* be reformed to
some extent to decrease injustices. It took time, but after the initial TRIPS agreement, the WIPO
has ackowledged that medicine should be affordable [145], that copyrighted material more easily
accessible to disabled people [146], and that traditional knowledge cannot be protected as IP [147].
Lightyears away from perfect, but better than nothing.


### III.IV. AI Changes IP But Does Not Make It Obsolete

We've now arrived at the inevitable AI segment. There are two opposing views on generative models.
A: the model creates new data in a process similar to how humans are inspired by artworks. B: the
model simply reshuffles data; its training dataset is so large that it just gives the impression of
novelty. We need more research into interpretability to understand what's going on; we already have
some results that support either view [148] [149] and you can choose which one you prefer depending
on your biases. But even if this is genuine creativity, AI model outputs will remain
non-copyrightable because, as the US copyright office puts it, IP is meant to reward *human*
creativity [150], that's why this image will remain in public domain [151]. Another argument is that
humans themselves are not truly creative and just reshuffle previously seen data... you're free to
believe that but artificial neural networks they don't work like human brains, they don't have
subjective experiences. At least the current ones don't. And they don't have *interests*. I think
this argument is often brought up because online platforms tend to promote controversial opinions,
but I have yet to hear about a judge or policymaker taking it seriously. Another issue is that tech
companies are making money with models trained on unpaid material. This is far from over, but we can
already see that while tech companies try to erode copyright for users, they want to reinforce their
own copyright [152], and we can only hope governments won't make fools of themselves.


## IV. What I Think of This

What I think of this: I think the problems are with power more than ownership.

Governments have often sided with companies, like when drafting the semiconductor act and giving
more power to Intel. Tech companies rely on secrecy, surveillance, and evergreening to extract as
much wealth as they can from the working class. The US Supreme Court has made some sketchy ruling,
deciding that, while *genes* cannot be patented, *complementary DNA* can be [153], which many
biologists have described as scientifically inconsistent [154]. You know who delivered the opinion
of the court? Clarence Thomas [155]. You know what's one of his favorite book? Atlas Shrugged by Ayn
Rand [156]. These examples annoy me because they are breaches of the social contract. The idea is
that the state gives temporary monopolies to reward ingenuity, but when people hack the system
through lobbying, or companies abuse their power over consumers, or incompetent government officials
misinterpret science, ingenuity gets rewarded less than trickery and luck. I think addressing that
is urgent: we should make government decisions more accountable and democratic, counter evergreening
and surveillance capitalism, demand policymakers to listen more seriously to scientists. This is
more realistic than throwing IP away.

Another point I noticed is how IP is closely tied to cultural identity. In Europe, appellations
d'origine contrôlées label products made according to specific traditions, like Champagne wine and
feta cheese. Using these words for other products is illegal [157], which sounds pretty weird to
North Americans because most products over yonder are not really tied to traditions. People have
different opinions on what is fair to use as training for AI models, on how much money artists
deserve to get, on what qualifies as art. Because we all have different experiences and interests. I
now see a lot of debates around IP not as problem-solving, but more as people with different
perspectives not understanding the other's positions and clashing over instead. If we are to have
*discussions* about making IP more fair, we need to acknowledge those differences.

Lastly, freedom is a word I often encountered while making the video. Yes, governments prevent us
from using certain ideas, you can see this as overreach, but those monopolies, imperfect as they
get, are often someone's livelihood. Maximum freedom for everyone is not realistic, as libertarians
admit themselves. I prefer to live in a society that lets people live are many different lives as
possible, to make as many *choices* as they can. And some IP restrictions do their part in that
because they give *some* power to creators.

  - Paragraph 26 on page 14 explains how foreign companies dominated patents in India:
    "The Patents Enquiry Committee have in their interim report [...] set out the figures of patents
    granted in various countries during the period 1930—37 together with the proportion of grants to
    its own nationals as compared with the number granted to foreigners. [...]. During this period
    the proportion of grants to Indians and foreigners is stated to be roughly 1:9. Even with the
    attainment of independence and rapid growth of scientific education by the opening of more
    institutions for post-graduate training and the establishment of several national laboratories,
    the proportion of Indian to foreign patents still remains substantially the same as during the
    earlier period, and is roughly 1:2 [...]. This is, however, without taking into account the
    economic or industrial or scientific importance of the inventions. If this factor were taken
    into account [...], our nationals would appear to be at even less advantage"
  - Paragraph 101 on page 39 explains the rationale behind removing product patents:
    "The reason for this state of law is stated to be that the denial of product claims is necessary
    in order that such important articles of daily use as medicine or food which are vital to
    the health of the community should be made available to every one at reasonable prices and
    that no monopoly should be granted in respect of such articles. It is considered that the refusal
    of product patents would enlarge the area of competition and thus result in the production of
    these articles in sufficient quantity and at the lowest possible cost to the public."

- [5] David Lewis. "We, the Navigators, The Ancient Art of Landfinding in the Pacific" (1972).
  - This paragraph on page 17 talks about how secretive navigators were:
    "Not that men fully trained in these important arts
    would necessarily have revealed their knowledge even if
    asked. We have evidence from widely separated parts of
    Oceania that navigational lore was usually restricted to a
    few and often considered secret, so that in the Marshalls
    it was 'strongly and religiously forbidden to divulge any-
    thing converning this art to the people' (Winkler, 1901:
    505), and in the Tahitian area there were 'few men who
    preserve the national traditions' (Forster, G., 1777: vol.
    II, 148). It is questionable whether Tupaia himself would
    have been so co-operative had he not been in exile and
    deprived of his proper position."
    Tupaia was a Polynesian navigator who assisted Lewis in writing the book.

  - Page 125: "Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and of physical
    effort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into a material form. The
    proportion of these two elements varies in different types of work. At the lowest end of the
    scale, the mental effort required to perform unskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other
    end, what the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in
    the production of material values; these laws protect the mind's contribution in its purest form
    the origination of an idea. The subject of patents and copyrights is intellectual property. ...
    Thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which it has brought in existence"
  - Page 127: "If it were held in perpetuity, it would lead to the opposite of the very principle on
    which it is based: it would lead, not to the earned reward of achievement, but to the unearned
    support of parasitism. It would become a cumulative lien on the production of unborn
    generations, which would ultimately paralyze them."

    self-produced and self-released their albums, sometimes through small DIY labels. The music and
    culture of hardcore was promoted through word of mouth and fanzines. As the genre grew in
    popularity, its musical acts developed numerous sonic variations and included political messages
    in their lyrics."
