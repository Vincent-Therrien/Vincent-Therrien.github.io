<p>GPU programming is a bit of a hassle. There are multiple frameworks to do it, but they only work on<br>
some platforms, they use weird shading languages, or they don't support some features. In some<br>
cases, you have to combine several frameworks in a single project. I made an entire video just to<br>
complain about how impractical it gets.</p>
<p>CPU programming, meanwhile, is much more convenient: an application written in a modern programming<br>
language can run on almost any CPU on the market. It used to be much worse: developers would<br>
manually translate programs to target different CPU architectures [1] and buy compiler toolchains to<br>
build their applications [2]. But things improved a lot over time.</p>
<p>So, why is there such a big difference between the two? Why is GPU programming so chaotic?</p>
<h2>The CPU Market</h2>
<p>To answer this question, we first need to look at how CPU programming evolved. I promise it's<br>
important for the GPU section.</p>
<p>A central processing unit, or <strong>CPU</strong>, is an electrical component in a computer that executes<br>
instructions, like mathematical calculations or input/output operations [3]. It works by reading<br>
machine code, a sequence of instructions that looks like this [4] [5]. Writing machine code by hand<br>
is extremely tedious and error prone, so since the 1940s [6], people have been using assembly<br>
languages. They map machine code instructions to simple mnemonics, which facilitates programming.<br>
But they remain pretty hard to use and, since assemblers are tied to specific CPU architectures,<br>
your code has to be adapted to different platforms [3].</p>
<p>Another improvement came in the form of programming languages, like Fortran and C. They are more<br>
high-level than assembly: instead of directly writing the instructions that a CPU will run, they use<br>
an abstract syntax made of keywords and mathematical symbols to express computations in a more<br>
intuitive way. This source code is then automatically converted into machine code by a compiler,<br>
which can target multiple CPU architectures [4].</p>
<p>Programming languages are very convenient, so you might imagine that at this point, CPU programming<br>
entered a golden era of smooth, easy development. It did not. Back in the 70s, the computer<br>
ecosystem was pretty fragmented and it was common for companies to control their products tightly.<br>
IBM, for instance, manufactured most components of its mainframe computers and wrote most of the<br>
software. Computers built with that kind of vertical integration were expensive, but IBM liked it<br>
because it completely controlled the platform [7]. Consumers were stuck in a vendor lock-in and had<br>
to rely on IBM for support. Apple had - still has - a similar strategy: it makes the hardware and<br>
software of its devices, and that gives it a lot of power. It would sell documentation and<br>
development tools back in the days [8]! However there are drawbacks to controlling your products too<br>
much: it makes you slower at adapting to the market, more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions,<br>
and it makes third-party development more difficult [9].</p>
<p>IBM realized it. It wanted to enter the home computer market but developing a new product from<br>
scratch would have taken too much time, so, instead, it decided to assemble components made by other<br>
companies [10]. And it worked: the IBM personal computer became a commercial success [11]. It also<br>
backfired. The PC was well documented to help other companies make its components, and competitors<br>
used this open design to copy the PC and sell compatible clones. IBM was not happy, but it did<br>
reduce prices for consumers and it did improve cross-compatibility.</p>
<p>There's always a tradeoff between openness and secrecy. If you publicly document your product,<br>
it's easier to develop it quickly and take over a market, but competitors can also free-ride it. If<br>
you keep your product as secret as possible, you can have higher margins, but it's more difficult to<br>
disrupt a market. We see the same thing with CPUs. When manufacturers document their chips well, it<br>
makes it easier for programmers to write and optimize code [12], that's a selling point. But<br>
manufacturers do not release the inner workings of their CPUs, they hide information and use legal<br>
protection to make sure that they preserve trade secrets.</p>
<p>So manufacturers used to control how computers were made and what software they could run,<br>
but competition between companies somehow pushed for more openness, which made it easier for<br>
developers to write compilers themselves instead of relying on manufacturers. Paid compilers still<br>
exist [13] [14], but they have become less common, we have free, cross-compatible ones now [15]<br>
[16]. Intel and IBM didn't publish documentation out of generosity, it was a business move to sell<br>
more products than their competitors. These companies can actually get quite anti-competitive once<br>
they begin dominating a market [8]. Another way to promote the interests of consumers is through<br>
public architectures. For example, RISC-V is an open CPU standard originally developed by the<br>
University of California, Berkeley. Anyone can make a RISC-V CPU without getting sued or having to<br>
pay for a license, and that encourages innovation in this industry [19].</p>
<p>Not all the time, but often, people prefer transparent technologies. Many popular programming<br>
languages are managed by non-profit organizations that listen to their users and provide stable,<br>
open documentation. Others are managed by companies and, while they can make good languages, they<br>
can also monetized them and ignore the feedback of the community, which can make them less<br>
attractive.</p>
<p>CPU programming is not perfect, but without competition and open projects, it might have remained in<br>
the dark age of vertical integration. Hey, I wonder if another segment of the tech industry is still<br>
stuck in the same horrible business practices.</p>
<h2>The GPU Market</h2>
<p>A graphics processing unit, or <strong>GPU</strong>, is an electrical component that executes instructions in<br>
parallel [20]. I know the name makes it seem like it's only for graphics, but practically any<br>
computation that can be split in parallel may benefit from GPUs. That includes some physics<br>
simulations [21] and DNA analyses [22], along with an obscure application called artificial<br>
intelligence [23]. Nvidia was the first company to formally define GPUs in the modern sense in 1999<br>
[24], but a lot of chips designed to manipulate images had been made before that [25].</p>
<p>Initially, these chips were only intended to run graphics pipelines that would take vertices,<br>
process them, and output images. This is called fixed-function programming: you can modify the<br>
parameters of the pipeline, but you cannot execute arbitrary code [26]. Each manufacturer had its<br>
own way of doing things, so you had to adapt your code to each GPU [27]. To address that, some<br>
companies made cross-platform standards like OpenGL and Direct3D, and developers adopted them<br>
because they improved productivity. Those are application programming <em>interfaces</em>, not compilers.<br>
They don't generate machine code that GPUs can run directly, but rather create standard instructions<br>
that GPU drivers convert into machine code [28]. And, a bit like at the beginning of the computer<br>
market, most GPU manufacturers would protect their architecture by releasing little detail about<br>
them. People couldn't write their own compilers, so the only way to use GPUs was through standard<br>
APIs or vendor-specific tools [29].</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, GPU APIs began supporting shaders, programs that let you run code at some stages<br>
of the graphics pipeline to obtain more varied visual effects. And people realized that you<br>
can also use them to accelerate other applications. But remember, you had to go through the graphics<br>
pipeline. So people would put numbers in textures, write shaders to process the textures, launch the<br>
pipeline, and then analyze the output images to obtain results [30]. That's a hideous hack, but they<br>
were stuck with it. Some projects tried to simplify that mess, but they were not backed by<br>
manufacturers and didn't really succeed [I]. Eventually, Nvidia caught glimpse of developers<br>
struggling with general-purpose programs and decided to release a framework called CUDA, which<br>
forgoes the graphics pipeline [32]. That is worlds more convenient and it became popular to train<br>
neural networks, many ground-breaking discoveries in the field were made using programs written with<br>
CUDA [33]. And it remains widely used. Nvidia is really dominant in the market, it controls around<br>
90 % of discrete GPUs [34], with AMD taking the rest and Intel barely selling anything [35].<br>
Discrete GPUs are the ones used for high-end graphics applications and training AI models. Another<br>
type of GPUs are the integrated ones. They are more often used in applications that require less<br>
computations, and Nvidia is not in that market [36].</p>
<p>As we've seen with CPUs, a device manufacturer has an interest in making their products less<br>
compatible to preserve a market advantage. Nvidia releases limited documentation of its GPUs, enough<br>
to help developers optimize their programs, but not enough for other manufacturers to make<br>
CUDA-compatible GPUs and free-ride its market [29]. IBM documented the PC because it was desperate<br>
to take over home computers quickly, and that improved cross-compatibility. Nvidia is already at the<br>
top, it doesn't need to disrupt the market by becoming more transparent. In an effort to win over<br>
some shares of the discrete GPU market, AMD and Intel document their GPUs more thoroughly and their<br>
frameworks are open-source [37] [38]. Not because they are freedom fighters, but to convince<br>
consumers to buy their products. However their openness has not really paid off so far, Nvidia is<br>
just too far ahead.</p>
<p>Companies want to promote their own APIs to sell their own hardware, but they have to enable some<br>
degree of cross-platform support, otherwise no one would buy their chips. And these two<br>
interests often collide. For example, Apple developed OpenCL as a direct response to CUDA. It<br>
enables general-purpose computing on GPUs, but it's designed to run everywhere [39]. Although<br>
several manufacturers support the first version, they decided not to support newer features to<br>
instead invest in their own APIs. OpenCL is a good API, but it stagnated over the years [40]. Vulkan<br>
has similar issues. It was made to succeed OpenGL as a cross-platform graphics API, so it has a set<br>
of mandatory features that GPU manufacturers agree to support. But some vendors wanted additional<br>
features that they had implemented on their own devices, so there are also optional Vulkan<br>
extensions that don't work everywhere [41]. A certain company decided not to support Vulkan at all,<br>
you have to use a weird compatibility layer on its devices [42]. So we got another API to improve<br>
cross-platform support [43], and this one also has some missing features [44]. I'm sure another<br>
projects will address them [45]. It never stops! Even when all manufacturers get together to make a<br>
common API, GPU programming always remains fragmented because of their competing interests.</p>
<p>From what I've gathered, the lack of competition is the main problem that plagues GPU programming,<br>
but it's not the only one. On a technical level, GPUs are massively parallel and have a lot of<br>
variations [46]. This complexity makes them more challenging to document than CPUs, which<br>
contributes to making the technology more opaque. And from a legal perspective, things have changed<br>
a lot since the early 80s. Governments have made it easier to copyright chip designs [47] and<br>
companies protect their intellectual property more aggressively: for example, Nvidia takes legal<br>
precautions to discourage running CUDA on other devices, again, to make sure that their consumers<br>
stay locked in the same ecosystem [48].</p>
<p>Overall, GPU programming is chaotic mainly because Nvidia's dominance hinders competition, which<br>
stalls cross-compatibility. Nvidia didn't use shadowy scheming, but rather built good GPUs, invested<br>
early in a good API, and used legal magic to protect its IP. Nowadays, a lot of consumers are kind<br>
of locked in its ecosystem. I don't think Jensen Huang is a Final Fantasy villain who wants to make<br>
GPU programming more cumbersome for no reason, I think his company finds ways to maximize profit to<br>
the detriment of everyone else, like all companies do. But, when they go too far, there can be<br>
consequences.</p>
<h2>Antitrust</h2>
<p>In 1974, the US government filed an antitrust action against AT&amp;T for monopolizing the telephone<br>
infrastructure [49]. Monopolies, by the way, are legal according to the federal trade commission, as<br>
long as you don't use them to harm the market with predatory practices [50]. But since the forties,<br>
AT&amp;T had been sued for abusing its market power. There were many points of contention, but a<br>
particularly egregious one was its subsidiary Western Electric, which manufactured telephone<br>
equipment. AT&amp;T controlled how a lot of phones were made and how they operated. It could dictate<br>
prices, and this situation became increasingly problematic.</p>
<p>The United States, and most other countries, have competition laws, also called antitrust laws [51].<br>
They regulate monopolies, collusion, they supervise mergers and acquisition, they basically address<br>
any market behavior that may lead to predatory practices. AT&amp;T was clearly going against antitrust<br>
laws, but before the state can break a monopoly, it has to prove that it is harming the market, and<br>
gathering enough evidence for that takes time. It took around 8 years to reach a settlement, and<br>
AT&amp;T got split up in multiple companies [52]. There have been more recent antitrust cases, Apple has<br>
some experience in that field [53], as well as Amazon [54], Google [55], Microsoft [56], Intel [57].<br>
But they didn't get ripped apart à la AT&amp;T. Yet.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice started investigating Nvidia in 2024 because of its dominant market<br>
position [58]. And like, yeah, it really looks like a monopoly [59]. I would be the first one to<br>
cheer if CUDA was forced to become more transparent or if architectures were made more open, then<br>
GPUs would become way more convenient to program. But that is highly unlikely and it would take at<br>
least several years, so let's not look forward to that.</p>
<p>There are some arguments in favor of monopolies. For instance, you might argue that large companies<br>
are more productive than smaller ones and splitting monopolies too aggressively could hinder<br>
progress [60]. Or that the state is ran by incompetents and we should just let the market regulate<br>
itself [61]. The worst argument is that once a company establishes a monopoly and extorts money, it<br>
creates a business opportunity: another company can propose a cheaper product, which breaks the<br>
monopoly [62]. But that almost never happens, large companies have so much resources that they can<br>
easily put barriers to entry that prevent competition. NO ONE could have competed with AT&amp;T at the<br>
time, and I don't see how anyone could dislodge Nvidia now.</p>
<p>The reality is that the invisible hand only works in a world of small shop owners. Large companies<br>
are too powerful for small competitors and they only work in their own interest. They are unaligned,<br>
if you will. The state has the responsibility to maintain a healthy economic environment and ensure<br>
that the rights of consumers are respected, at the same time, it is bound to follow judicial<br>
procedures, so we may remain stuck with monopolies or quasi-monopolies for years.</p>
<h2>Can It Get Better</h2>
<p>Rather than waiting for big government to do everything for us, we can ask ourselves if GPU<br>
programming might get better without antitrust miracles, and, there are a few possibilities.</p>
<p>The first one is to just hope for competition to get more intense. AMD and Intel are, hum, doing<br>
their best I'm sure, but they are not serious competitors. In China, 摩尔线程 (Moore Thread) is<br>
a relatively new GPU manufacturer that could stir competition up [63]. Maybe these companies will<br>
get better and push for more transparency. There are also projects to make open architectures, a bit<br>
like RISC-V but for GPUs, and they could encourage innovation and cross-compatibility [64] [65].</p>
<p>Another possibility is for consumers to put pressure on Nvidia. Zum Beispiel, if developers start<br>
using open frameworks instead of CUDA, Nvidia might decide to improve support for these projects.<br>
But we have no way of forcing Nvidia to react positively to open-source projects. I would definitely<br>
not favor more direct forms of pressure like boycotts because Nvidia is so large that there's no way<br>
consumers could significantly alter its market presence. To be clear, boycotts are not useless, in<br>
many cases, they have successfully forced companies to fix problematic behaviors [66] [67] [68]. But<br>
there's a limit to what boycotts can accomplish, and trying to make CUDA open-source by canceling<br>
Nvidia on Twitter is not gonna work. I think that the market is in a disastrous state and the only<br>
thing we can do is live with it. Whether GPU programming will get better is out of our control, but<br>
we can slightly push for more transparency in that field with open-source projects and by electing<br>
people who favor stricter antitrust regulations.</p>
<p>Some of you might be sitting in disbelief at how much of a non-issue this whole situation is. "GPU<br>
programming works. The applications you write in Vulkan or OpenCL or a game engine will function<br>
on almost any GPU on the market, there's no need to freak out!" And, fair, it's not <em>that</em> bad, we<br>
don't have to pay for GPU compilers at least. But it could be so much better. The CPU programming<br>
ecosystem is convenient enough that hobbyists can easily share their projects with people who don't<br>
necessarily have the same hardware. Python was started by one guy [69], it's now one of the most<br>
widely used programming languages and anyone can contribute to it [70]. This is the strength of<br>
openness: when you let people freely collaborate, the best ideas rise to the top and meliorate<br>
technology to the benefit of everyone. It's never perfect, but it's much better than when companies<br>
make their products incompatible on purpose.</p>
<p>Another beef I have with GPU programming is that, in most cases, you have to keep the CPU and GPU<br>
source codes separate. There are projects, like Rust-GPU [71], OpenMP [72], and SYCL [73], that let<br>
you integrate GPU code within CPU code, which is more convenient to write but in practice that code<br>
is compiled in pretty convoluted ways because GPUs are not built for compatibility [74]. With more<br>
open architectures, we could develop open-source, cross-platform compilers more easily. That would<br>
not impact graphics applications much I think, but for general-purpose computing, it would be really<br>
practical. Heterogeneous computing might become more widely used and enhance informatics as a whole.<br>
So I'm not exactly mad at the current GPU programming scene, well, a little. I am disheartened<br>
because it has the potential to get much better but we might never see that happen.</p>
<p>Ok I made my point. If you want more information on GPU programming, you can look up the Github<br>
repository I made to compare frameworks. I've added links to other interesting projects since last<br>
time. You can also check my other video on the topic, but I made some errors in it so make sure to<br>
read my pinned comment for the errata. I hope I wasn't too discouraging, GPU programming is really<br>
fun and useful despite what the market has done to it. I should do a video to prove that.</p>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The thesis of the video is that competition somehow forces company to become transparent, which<br>
leads to open-source compilers and operating systems. I think that competition is required because<br>
a vertically integrated technology can more easily be protected by its manufacturer. However,<br>
competition is not the only thing require to have open-source projects, you also need:
<ul>
<li>A community of developers working on open-source projects. Research institutes can also<br>
contribute (e.g. UC Berkeley for RISC-V).</li>
<li>Public organizations (e.g. ISO, W3C, IETF) that make standards like programming languages or<br>
protocol specifications.</li>
<li>A well-regulated market - technology would be barely usable without antitrust laws.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intel and AMD have a very weird history, you cna read it at<br>
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/how-amd-became-a-chip-giant-leapfrogged-intel-after-playing-catch-up.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/how-amd-became-a-chip-giant-leapfrogged-intel-after-playing-catch-up.html</a></li>
<li>I focused on Intel in the CPU section, but ARM is also very widely used, especially in phones. ARM<br>
has a different business model compared to Intel. Instead of designing and manufacturing CPUs, it<br>
licenses its CPU designs to other companies. You have to pay to access ARM CPU designs, but the<br>
instruction set architecture (i.e. the interface of the CPU) is public, like x86.</li>
